# IST719 - Information Visualization

## Disclaimer:
The material posted here is a represenation of my work for the course IST719.
It is designed to demonstrate the quality of my work.

## Opening Comments:
I took this course towards the end of my time at Syracuse.  The books used in this course were excellent.  The time required for this course was a LOT but it was time well spent.  elling a story with data is an art and a science.

## 1. Assignments:
Assignments were completed in the program R.  

## 2. Final Project:   Create a Large Poster Board to Tell a Story
I used historical domestic airline flight data from 2004 to 2022.  The story I put forth was that airline passengers are right to be upset at the state of airtravel.  In the last year of data (2022) things looked pretty bleak.

## Closing Remarks:
I enjoyed this course immensely.  Easily in the top 3 courses I took at Syracuse.
